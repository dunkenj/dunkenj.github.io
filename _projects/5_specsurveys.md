## About

Given the decades of ongoing spectroscopic surveys and the increasing number of large-scale spectroscopic surveys from next generation facilities such as DESI, 4MOST and WEAVE, keeping track of the full literature and the parameter space covered by these surveys is a significant challenge.

Inspired by the long-running [compilation and overview plot compiled by Ivan Baldry](https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/research/galaxy-redshift-surveys.html), the dashboard above is designed allow easy visualisation of the parameter space covered by these surveys, including filtering by different properties and downloading of the filtered data for further analysis and easy access to the relevant survey papers.

The dashboard is hosted at [specsurveysdb.onrender.com](https://specsurveysdb.onrender.com), with the underlying code and surveys data contained in a [GitHub repository](http://dunkenj.github.io/specsurveysdb). This database of surveys is designed to be a living document that is updated regularly and is intended to be a resource for the community. The database is currently in beta*, feedback and contributions are welcomed from the community and can be made via the [GitHub repository](http://dunkenj.github.io/specsurveysdb). Corrections or additions to the survey data are particularly welcomed.

*_As such, it is currently deployed on a free tier of a cloud service and may be slow to load initially. If you experience issues, please try refreshing the page or waiting a few minutes._
