# Galaxy and Cosmology Spectroscopic Surveys

Given the decades of ongoing spectroscopic surveys and the increasing number of large-scale spectroscopic surveys from next generation facilities such as DESI, 4MOST and WEAVE, keeping track of the full literature and the parameter space covered by these surveys is a significant challenge.

Inspired by the long-running [compilation and overview plot compiled by Ivan Baldry](https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/research/galaxy-redshift-surveys.html), I have developed a new database of galaxy and cosmology spectroscopic surveys and an interactive dashboard to visualise the parameter space covered by these surveys. The dashboard is designed to allow easy filtering by different properties. The filtered results can then be downloaded as a CSV file for further analysis and easy access to the relevant survey papers.

The dashboard is hosted at [specsurveysdb.onrender.com](https://specsurveysdb.onrender.com), with the underlying code and surveys data contained in a [GitHub repository](http://dunkenj.github.io/specsurveysdb) and is open for contributions from the community. This database is designed to be a living document that is updated regularly and is intended to be a resource for the community to track the full parameter space covered by these surveys.
