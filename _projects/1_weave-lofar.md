The WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE) is a next generation multi-object spectrograph (~1000 fibres) currently undergoing commissioning on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT).
Once commissioned, WEAVE will undertake a suite of surveys covering a broad range of scientific topics.
Amongst these, the WEAVE-LOFAR survey, will provide over 1 million high resolution optical spectra for sources detected by the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Surveys (LoTSS).

### Survey Goals
Given the scale of the survey the WEAVE-LOFAR science case is extremely broad, covering themes across galaxy evolution and cosmology.
A number of the research themes most closely related to my reseach are:

- The history of accretion and AGN driven feedback: WEAVE spectra will provide precise distance information, enable accurate source classifications and provide measurements of fundamental physical properties (e.g. SMBH masses) for samples of radio AGN more than $$100\times$$ larger than previously available. The spectral resolution offered by WEAVE will also open up new opportunities for studying the details of stellar and AGN feedback.
- Probing the epoch of re-ionization (EoR): The enormous sample size available thanks to WEAVE means that WEAVE-LOFAR will be able to detect some of the rarest and most extreme. A key example will be the discovery of $$z > 6$$ radio galaxies suitable for 21cm absorption experiments, that could open a new window for studying the process of cosmic re-ionization.
- Cosmic star formation history:

The combination of area and sensitivity of LoTSS with the unprecedented complementary optical spectra from WL present a unique and truly transformational new dataset with which to study SMBH and galaxy formation.
