## PEARLS 
I am a co-investigator of the 'Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science' ([PEARLS](https://sites.google.com/view/jwstpearls)) led by Prof. Rogier Windhorst.
In particular, within this team I have led the planning and analysis of the NIRCam observations of the luminous high-redshift radio galaxy TNJ1338-1942.

The first paper based on these observations, [Duncan et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.4548D/abstract), presents a resolved study of the radio galaxy host properties and the extensive jet activity.

    HST and JWST imaging of the TNJ1338-1942 radio galaxy at $z=4.1$. The new NIRCam bands reveal the full extent of the jet-aligned emission that is dominated by strong nebular emission, while also allowing tight constraints on the host galaxy and its formation history..

Future work will characterise the wider protocluster environment surrounding TNJ1338 and the role this environment is playing in the formation of its constituent galaxies.

## PRIMER and JELS
I am aslo co-investigator in both the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER; PI Dunlop) and JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS; PI Best) led here at the University of Edinburgh.
