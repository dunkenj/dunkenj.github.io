I am an extra-galactic observational astronomer currently working at the [Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh](https://ifa.roe.ac.uk), where I currently hold an STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship.
My main research interest is the early formation of galaxies and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies at high redshift, with a particular focus on the combination of next-generation radio observations with multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic surveys from a wide range of facilities.

As part of this work, I have a leading role within a number of major observing collaborations, with further membership of a broad range of ongoing programmes across the electromagnetic spectrum. Further details can be found on my [Research](https://dunkenj.github.io/research/) page.


### Education
<p>I completed my PhD at the University of Nottingham under the supervision of Prof. Chris Concelice, where my thesis was titled 'The Growth of the First Galaxies'. Before then, I attended the University of Durham, completing an MPhys in Physics.</p>
