I am an extra-galactic observational astronomer currently working at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, where I currently hold a Marie Sk&lstrok;odowska-Curie Research Fellowship.
My main research interest is the early formation of galaxies and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies at high redshifts.
I am Deputy Science Team Lead for the [WEAVE-LOFAR](https://ingconfluence.ing.iac.es:8444/confluence//display/WEAV/WEAVE-LOFAR) spectroscopic survey and have a significant role in the [LOFAR](http://lofar.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) Surveys Key Science Project.
In addition to these main roles, I also work with the [Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project](http://http://hedam.lam.fr/HELP/) and [CANDELS](http://candels.ucolick.org/) collaborations.

### Education
<p>I completed my PhD at the University of Nottingham under the supervision of Prof. Chris Concelice, where my thesis was titled 'The Growth of the First Galaxies'. Before then, I attended the University of Durham, completing an MPhys in Physics.</p>
